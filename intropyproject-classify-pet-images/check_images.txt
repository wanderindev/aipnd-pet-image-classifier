1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the
differences in the classifications.
- alexnet classified Dog_01.jpg as a eskimo dog.
- resnet and vgg classified it as an elkhound.

2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as
that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.
No, in all three models, the classifications for Dog_01.jpg and Dog_02.jpg are different.  Details below:
Model      | Dog_01.jpg | Dog_02.jpg
alexnet    | eskimo dog | elkhound
resnet     | elkhound   | eskimo dog
vgg        | elkhound   | eskimo dog

3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Turtle_01.jpg and Chair_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not,
report the misclassifications.
All three models correctly classified Turtle_01.jpg and Chair_01.jpg to not be dogs.

4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at
classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image
classification.
All 3 models performed equally well in classifying the images.  Also, for this small sample, the runtime was the same.
Therefore, we can't conclude that one model is better than the other based on this small sample.
